# Auto Spawn Egg Filter

## Description

The Auto Spawn Egg filter automatically creates texture-based spawn egg colors in entity files if "spawn_egg" isnt specified.
The filter uses a Python script (`auto_spawn_egg.py`) to generate the colors. It uses the `colorthief` library to determine the two most dominant colors.
Contributions are welcome!

## Requirements
