# MultiFeature - a Regolith Filter

A lightweight Regolith filter for simplifying Minecraft feature generation.

## 🧩 What is this?

The **MultiFeature** filter allows you to combine multiple Minecraft feature definitions in a single file and automatically split them into individual `.json` files during the Regolith build process.

This is useful when you're working with many related features and want to keep your logic grouped together in a single place — without using more complex or opinionated tools.

> ```
> regolith install multifeature

## 🆚 Why not use `MiniFeature`?

There’s a more advanced filter called [`MiniFeature`](https://github.com/BigChungus21220/minifeature-regolith-filter) which provides powerful capabilities like:

- Inline features
- YAML support
- Templating
- Conditional logic
- Outputting multiple file types

However, **this filter is purposefully simpler**.

### When to use `MultiFeature`:

- You only want to combine multiple features into a single file.
- You don’t need YAML, templating, or logic.
- You already use other filters for those tasks.
- You want to avoid conflicts with more opinionated filters like `MiniFeature`.

## 💡 How it works

This filter scans the `BP/multifeatures/` folder and finds all files ending in `.multifeature.json`. Each of these files is expected to be a **list of feature objects** (rather than a single feature). The filter will:

1. Parse each feature inside the list.
2. Update its identifier and `places_feature` fields using a custom subfolder prefix (if configured).
3. Export it to `BP/features/` or `BP/feature_rules/`, depending on the feature type.
4. Automatically create the correct folder structure.

### Example Input (`my_features.multifeature.json`)

```json
[
  {
    "format_version": "1.18.0",
    "minecraft:feature_rules": {
      "description": {
        "identifier": "mymod:trees/oak_forest",
        "places_feature": "mymod:trees/oak_tree"
      },
      ...
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

## 📦 Integration

This filter is best used alongside others for:

- String replacements
- Json templating
- YAML-to-JSON conversion

Check out my other filters for these capabilities — this one is kept **minimal by design**, so you can mix and match as needed.

## 🚫 Inline Features Not Supported (and Why)

This filter **does not support inline/nested features**. This is intentional:

- Inline features can hurt readability, especially for large or complex projects.
- Minecraft features can only place other features in a strictly 1-to-1, linear fashion—nesting does not create a true hierarchy.
- For aggregate features (where multiple features are spawned), it is strongly recommended to create separate files for each feature. This keeps your project organized and easy to maintain.

## 📝 YAML & Modularity Strongly Recommended

I highly recommend using YAML for your feature definitions and project files. YAML is more readable, supports multiline strings, and allows you to use visual breaks (like `---`) to separate entries or sections. For example, you can use `---` to divide files or for multiline strings, making your files much easier to read and edit.

To work with YAML or multiline strings in JSON, use my [Jsonify filter](https://github.com/BigChungus21220/jsonify-regolith-filter) (the bread and butter of my workflow). Jsonify lets you:

- Write your entire project in YAML, not just features.
- Use multiline strings in JSON directly.
- Choose your own listing syntax and file organization.

**All my filters are modular:** only use what you need, and combine them as you see fit for your workflow.

If you’re looking for a full-featured system: use `MiniFeature`.

If you just want a clean, focused solution for breaking up feature files — this is the tool for you.

Made with ❤️ for Minecraft Bedrock creators.

## 🛠️ VS Code: Schema Support for `.multifeature.json`

**Good news!** Schema support is now automatically installed when you run this filter.

The filter will automatically configure VS Code to provide validation and autocompletion for your `.multifeature.json` files by adding the appropriate schema association to your VS Code settings.

If you need to manually configure it (or prefer to do it yourself), you can:

1. Open your VS Code settings (`Ctrl+,` or `Cmd+,`).
2. Search for `json.schemas` and click `Edit in settings.json`.
3. Add an entry like this:

   ```json
   "json.schemas": [
     {
       "fileMatch": ["*.multifeature.json"],
       "url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thePixelmancer/regolith-filters/refs/heads/main/multifeature/data/multifeature.schema.json"
     }
   ]
   ```

This will enable validation and helpful autocompletion for all `.multifeature.json` files in your workspace.
